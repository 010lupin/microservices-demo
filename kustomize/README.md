# Use Kustomize to deploy Online Boutique with variants

This page walks you through the deployment options for the [Online Boutique](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo) sample application on a [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine) cluster using Kustomize. Each deployment variant is designed as a [**Kustomize Component**](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/blob/master/examples/components.md), so you can enable multiple variants at once.

## What is Kustomize?

Kustomize is a Kubernetes configuration management tool that allows users to customize their manifest configurations without duplication. Its commands are built into `kubectl` as `apply -k`. This repo uses Kustomize to enable Online Boutique deployment variants; a complete list of variants can be found at [/README.md](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo#other-deployment-options). More information on Kustomize can be found on the [official Kustomize website](https://kustomize.io/).

## Supported Deployment Variations

| **Variation Name**                                                                                                         | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Cymbal Branding](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo/blob/main/docs/cymbal-shops.md)                | Changes all Online Boutique-related branding to Google Cloud's fictitious company â€” Cymbal Shops. The code adds/enables an environment variable `CYMBAL_BRANDING` in the `frontend` service.                                                                                                 |
| [Google Cloud Operations](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo/blob/main/docs/gcp-instrumentation.md) | Enables Monitoring (Stats), Tracing, Profiler, and Debugger for various services within Online Boutique. The code removes the existing environment variables (`DISABLE_STATS`, `DISABLE_TRACING`, `DISABLE_PROFILER`, `DISABLE_DEBUGGER`) from appropriate YAML config files.                  |
| [Memorystore](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo/blob/main/docs/memorystore.md)                     | The default Online Boutique deployment uses the default in-cluster `redis` database for storing the contents of its shopping cart. The Memorystore deployment variation overrides the default database with its own Memorystore (Redis) database. These changes directly affect `cartservice`. |

## Deployment Instructions

This section outlines the steps to deploy any of the supported variations of Online Boutique. 

### Prerequisites

Before proceeding, you will need:
1. a Kubernetes cluster, such as a [GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine) cluster or a [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/) cluster.
1. to set your `kubectl` context to the Kuberneter cluster.

Alternatively, if you would like to quickly provision a GKE cluster and any other Google Cloud Platform (GCP) resources required for the variants that you choose to run (e.g., a Memorystore Redis cart), you can use the [Online Boutique's Terraform setup at /terraform](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo/tree/main/terraform).

### Using Memorystore

If you are enabling the **Memorystore** deployment variation, first complete the steps in the **[Additional Deployment Instructions (Memorystore)](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo/edit/readme/kustomize/README.md#additional-deployment-instructions-memorystore)** section below to make the appropriate infrastructure changes before continuing. Alternatively, if you have completed the manual infrastructure steps outlined in the [Memorystore docs](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo/edit/readme/docs/memorystore.md), proceed with the normal deployment steps.

### Run the deployment options

1. While in the `microservices-demo` directory, enter the `kustomize/` directory.

    ```
    cd kustomize
    ```

1. Edit the base level `kustomization.yaml` so that it uses the components you wish to use.

    ```
    nano kustomization.yaml
    ```

    The file should contain a similar snippet of code with only the component variants that you intend to deploy left uncommented.
    
    ```
    components:
      - components/cymbal-branding
      - components/google-cloud-operations
      # - components/memorystore
     ```

    Note: The example above will enable both the Cymbal Branding and Google Cloud Operations components in the new deployment.

    Note: To close `nano`, press `Ctrl`/`control` + `x`. To save changes, press `y`, then press `Enter`/`return`.

1. Check to see what changes will be made to the existing deployment config.

    ```
    kustomize build .
    ```

1. Apply the Kustomize deployment changes to the existing deployment.

    ```
    kubectl apply -k .
    ```

    Note: It may take 2-3 minutes before the changes are reflected on the deployment.

1. **Wait for the Pods to be ready.**

    ```
    kubectl get pods
    ```

    After a few minutes, you should see:

    ```
    NAME                                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    adservice-76bdd69666-ckc5j               1/1     Running   0          2m58s
    cartservice-66d497c6b7-dp5jr             1/1     Running   0          2m59s

    recommendationservice-69c56b74d4-7z8r5   1/1     Running   0          3m1s
    shippingservice-6ccc89f8fd-v686r         1/1     Running   0          2m58s
    ```

1. **Access the web frontend in a browser** using the frontend's `EXTERNAL_IP`.

    ```
    kubectl get service frontend-external | awk '{print $4}'
    ```

    **Note**- you may see `<pending>` while GCP provisions the load balancer. If this happens, wait a few minutes and re-run the command.

### Cleanup

After you have run the deployment variant on Online Boutique, you will want to reset the sample application back to its vanilla state.

1. While still in the `kustomize/` directory, re-apply the original Kubernetes config to the Online Boutique deployment.
    
    ```
    kubectl apply -f base
    ```
    
    Note: It may take 2-3 minutes before the changes are reflected on the deployment.

### NOTE: Memorystore

If you have enabled the **Memorystore** deployment variation, complete the additional cleanup steps in the **[Additional Deployment Instructions (Memorystore)](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo/edit/readme/kustomize/README.md#additional-deployment-instructions-memorystore)** section below to properly undo the Terraform changes.

## Additional Deployment Instructions (Memorystore)

### Run the infrastructure changes with Terraform

1. While in the `microservices-demo` directory, enter the `terraform/` directory.

    ```
    cd terraform
    ```

1. Open the `terraform.tfvars` file. Replace `<project_id_here>` with the [GCP Project ID](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects?hl=en#identifying_projects) for the `gcp_project_id` variable. Change the value of `memorystore = false` to `memorystore = true`.

1. Initialize Terraform.

    ```
    terraform init
    ```

1. See what resources will be created.

    ```
    terraform plan
    ```

1. Create the resources and deploy the updated infrastructure.

    ```
    terraform apply
    ```
    
    1. If there is a confirmation prompt, type `yes` and hit Enter/Return.
    
    Note: Following completion, there may be an error saying that the cluster already exists-- this is okay.

1. While in the `terraform/` directory, return back to the `microservices-demo/` directory.

    ```
    cd ..
    ```

At this point, you may return back to the **Deployment Instructions** section above.

### Additional Cleanup

1. Enter the `terraform/` directory.

    ```
    cd ../terraform
    ```

1. Undo the additional Terraform infrastructure by targeting the Memorystore instance.

    ```
    terraform destroy -target=google_redis_instance.redis-cart
    ```
    1. If there is a confirmation prompt, type `yes` and hit Enter/Return.
